Undefined-Null

The value undefined means value is not assigned & you don’t know its value. It is an unintentional absence of value.
It means that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

The value null indicates that you know that the field does not have a value. It is an intentional absence of value.

HTTP Request 

An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server.

GET: GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server. GET returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) if the data is successfully retrieved from the server.

POST: POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the server. On successful creation, it returns an HTTP status code of 201.

PUT: A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload. If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one.

PATCH: PATCH is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will only replace the content that you want to update.

DELETE: A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.

HTTP status code
An HTTP status code is a message a website’s server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that request can be fulfilled.
1xx: Informational
2xx: Success!
3xx: Redirect. The requested page has moved somewhere else.
4xx: Client error. There’s something wrong with the way the browser asked for the page.
5xx: Server error. Something went wrong with the way the server tried to send the page.

Interface

In TypeScript, an interface is an abstract type that tells the compiler which property names a given object can have. TypeScript creates implicit interfaces when you define an object with properties. 
It starts by looking at the object’s property name and data type using TypeScript’s type inference abilities.
*******************

Class-Object
Class is a detailed description, the definition, and the template of what an object will be. But it is not the object itself.
Object is an instance of a class. All data members and member functions of the class can be accessed with the help of objects. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated, but memory is allocated when it is instantiated.
*******************
Inversion of control bir yazılım tasarım prensibidir. Ioc ile Uygulama içerisindeki obje instance’larının yönetimi sağlanarak, bağımlılıklarını en aza indirgemek amaçlanmaktadır.
Inversion of Control’ün getirdiği avantajlar;

Bir methodun implementasyonundan izole bir şekilde çalıştırılabilmesini sağlar.
Farklı implementasyonlar arasında, kolayca geçiş yapabilmenizi sağlar.
Program modülerliğini artırır.
Bağımlılıklar en aza indiği için test etmeyi/yazmayı kolaylaştırır.

Dependency Injection
dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service).
There are basically three types of dependency injection:
-constructor injection: the dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
-setter injection: the client exposes a setter method that the injector uses to inject the dependency.
-interface injection: the dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it. Clients must implement an interface that exposes a setter method that accepts the dependency.

So now its the dependency injection’s responsibility to:
-Create the objects
-Know which classes require those objects
-And provide them all those objects
